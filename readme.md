# Pluton

A professional landing page for a fictitious data company that I decided to call Pluton.

## 🔎 Informations:

The goal is to simulate the promotion of a data management service to potential clients, while of course practicing my knowledge of the famous markup languages. However, the project is not limited to just that.

### ⚙️ Requirements

If you want to play around with this project, make modifications or anything like that, you will need two things:

- **Node.js** </br>
  You need to have Node.js version 20+ installed on your operating system.
- **Sass** <br/>
  You will also need Sass, the CSS pre-compiler used in this project, to make changes to the landing page style.

### 🛠️ Running the Tests

Right after installing the two prerequisites, you will need to run a very simple command in your terminal (in the project directory, obviously), to make Sass compile your CSS code with all the necessary adaptations, consequently making the browser understand it. This command is:

```
sass --watch assets/sass/main.scss assets/css/main.css --no-source-map
```
